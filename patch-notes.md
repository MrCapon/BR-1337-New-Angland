## New roman_world international organization:
roman_world_desc: "Romaiokratía is the system through which Roman supremacy is recognized and upheld. It encompasses all realms and authorities that acknowledge the Basileus as the ultimate source of legitimacy, whether directly ruled or bound by obligation. Each member strengthens imperial authority, while failure to honor duties weakens the cohesion of the Roman order."

- Currently pretty bare-bones; will be expanded in future updates. Members send money to Constantinople via a slider — the more paid, the greater the benefits. Paying less than 50% of the expected amount applies penalties. Members will unite against external aggressors.

- **Méga Palátion**:  
  "The principal imperial residence and ceremonial heart of the Roman state, comprising audience halls, chapels, residences, and gardens where emperors governed and enacted the rituals of empire."

- **Hagia Sophia**:  
  "$hagia_sophia$ was originally constructed c. 346 during the reign of Emperor Constantius II, burned down during the Nika Revolt in 532, and fully reconstructed and consecrated in 537 by Emperor Justinian, becoming the largest cathedral in Christendom. Designed by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus, it is renowned for its immense dome, innovative engineering, and detailed mosaics that reflect the grandeur of Orthodox Christianity."  
  - br_hagia_sophia_building_maintenance: "Hagia Sophia Maintenance"

- **The Sénaton**:  
  "The hall in which the Sýnklētos (Senate) convenes, preserving the unbroken civic tradition of the Roman people from the ancient Republic, through Constantine, and into the present age."

- **Pandidakterion**:  
  "Founded to preserve and cultivate the totality of Roman knowledge, the Pandidakterion stands as the foremost center of learning in the empire. Here, law, philosophy, rhetoric, medicine, and theology are taught in an unbroken tradition stretching back to Late Antiquity. Scholars trained within its halls shape the imperial administration, the courts, and the conscience of the Roman world itself."  
  - br_constantinople_university_maintenance: "Pandidakterion Maintenance"

- **Kontoskalion & Prosphorion**:  
  "The twin harbors of the Queen of Cities, where the lifeblood of the Roman world flows in and out with the tides. From the sheltered basins of the Kontoskalion to the bustling quays of the Prosphorion, grain fleets, merchants, and war galleys alike have sustained Constantinople since its founding. Fortified, regulated, and ceaselessly active, these ports bind the capital to every sea under Roman influence."

- **Hippodrome of Constantinople**:  
  "The great arena of the capital, where sport, ceremony, and politics converge before the eyes of the people. More than a place of spectacle, the Hippodrome has long served as a public forum through which popular will, factional rivalry, and imperial authority are expressed. Its crowds have celebrated emperors, condemned ministers, and shaped the rhythm of civic life in the Queen of Cities."

## Balance / Map Changes

- Bulgarian Releasables
  - B0L: "Dobrudja"
  - B2L: "Melnik"
- Roman Bulgarian Releasables
  - B3L: "Serdika"

- AN2: "Sebásteia"
- AN3: "Koloneia"
- AN4: "Kharsianon"
- AN5: "Seleukeía"

### Previously Releaseable now on map at start
- K1B: Kibyrrhaiōtai

## New Estate Privleges
- The following flavored naval debuff has been given to the Basileia Romaion in place of the base game's Burgher Corruption privilege.
  - Latin Maritime Reliance: "Imperial naval administration has grown dependent upon Latin merchant fleets and their capital. In return for sustained access to ships and maritime expertise, the state has granted extensive commercial privileges, shifting naval costs outward while eroding native levies, sailors, and imperial control of the seas."

## New Country Ranks:
- 'Dioíkēsis' replacing fiefdoms in the ERE.
- 'Nautikē Strategía' rank, ruled by a Strategós unless using the overlord’s ruler, for Kibyrrhaiōtai and Aigaíon Pélagos.
- 'Hetaireía' for certain trade company tags and any new ones that are subjects of a Hellenic culture. They are ruled by a Logothétēs.

## Government reform
- Kibyrrhaiōtai and Aigaíon Pélagos have been given the following naval-themed government reform, which boosts their naval potential.
  - Naval Theme Administration: "Coastal and island districts are organized into naval themes, where land, service, and fleet obligation are bound together. Through regulated levies and permanent maritime infrastructure, the state sustains large galley forces, rapid embarkation, and disciplined control of the frontier seas."

- Steppe Tolerance: "Ruling over a vast and diverse steppe realm, the state governs through pragmatism rather than enforced unity. Customs, faiths, and peoples are permitted to coexist so long as tribute flows and order is maintained. This tolerance eases cultural administration but slows efforts at assimilation and religious conversion."

## Balance changes

- Changed the starting towns in Bulgaria and Anatolia.
- Anatolian and Balkan population adjustments.
- Anatolian and Balkan building adjustments.

## Localization changes
- Changed many Greek location names to be more based on historic spelling and less on phonetics.

## Bug and compatibility fixes
- changed the country base value edits to INJECT instead of replace to make it more compatible with other mods that add effects to the base country values.
- Fixed tribal promotion bug I introduced.
- Last updated I increased the amount of pops required for towns and cities this was my attempt to balance AI turning everything into towns and cities.   Anyway I have decreased towns to 10k required pops from 15 and cities to 40k from 45k.
- Increased town and city control bonus from 0.05 to 0.1 and from 0.1 to 0.15.

  - **Akritic Reforms**

Soldier-settlers are bound to their districts by law and obligation, ensuring that the borderlands remain defended, governed, and unmistakably Roman.
